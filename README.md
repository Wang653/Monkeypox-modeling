# Monkeypox-modeling
Sample Matlab code for modeling and simulating the spread of monkeypox.

This code is related to the article "Revealing the complex dynamics of monkeypox epidemics in heterogeneous networks by the evolutionary game theory", Scientific Reports, 15: 29889 (2025).

The code MonkeypoxV_discrete_main.m generates line graphs for the transmission dynamics of monkeypox. The code Heatmap.m generates 2D heat maps for monkeypox epidemic distributions in various population networks.
